SMAQ is designed to monitor the air quality in your chosen environment. The sampling rate can be adjusted from 1Hz to 10Hz. The ```./Software/Real-Time``` repo handles all low-level I2C communications and transmits the data via UDP (over port 65000) in real time as the data is sampled - to a JavaScript UDP receiver.
The UDP receiver places the data in a csv file which is then used to populate live DyGraphs and dashboard gauges for each parameter. The data is stored up to a week and follows a ring-buffer logic afterwards (storage time can be modified depending on the available disk space & user preference).
An express WebApp is launched from ```./Software/Website``` repo on port 8000 and can be accessed via url "ipofRaspberryPi:8000" within the same network.

- SMAQ is able to:
    - Sense:
        - Temperature: <b>-45 to 80 Â°C</b>
        - Pressure: <b>300 to 1250 hPa</b>
        - Humidity: <b>0 to 100 %</b>
        - Ambient Light: <b>0.25 to 16K lux</b>
        - Proximity: <b>1 to 200 mm</b>
        - Sound Levels: <b>0 to 100 %</b>
        - Carbon Monoxide: <b>1 to 1000 ppm</b>
        - Nitrogen Dioxide: <b>0.05 to 10 ppm</b>
        - Ammonia: <b>1 to 500 ppm</b>
    - Show the current conditions in your chosen environment with gauges
    - Store data up to a week, autozoom to 1wk | 5d | 3d | 24hr | 12 hr | 6hr | 1hr on WebApp
    - Send you immediate alerts via Email / Mobile Notifications and LEDs
    - Auto-remove your alerts when they are outdated
    - Output API data in JSON format
    - Display current conditions on an OLED display triggered by proximity
    
## PCB Design
The design files are in sub-directory ```./Hardware```

## Building and running a demo
Clone and build the project with CMake
```
git clone https://github.com/MustafaBiyikli/SMAQ.git
cd SMAQ/Software/Real-Time
cmake .
make
```
Cmake will automatically check the I2C communication and run the necesarry tests when building the project. Test your harware by running a test.
```
./demo
```

This will start printing the sensor data onto your terminal. Press ```Enter``` to stop execution.

## Running the full WebApp
Start the cpp udp_transmitter in ```./Software/Real-Time``` as a background process:
```
./udp_transmit &
```

Then cd into ```../Website``` and run:
```
npm install
```

This will install the necessary NodeJS packages for the WebApp. Then, run udp_receive.js and app.js as background processes:
```
node udp_receive.js &
node app.js &
```
You can now visit your SMAQ WebApp on url: "ipofRaspberryPi:8000"

## Killing the processes
To stop the background process, find their PIDs by:
```
ps ax
```
and kill each process by:

```
kill -HUP <PID>
```

## Viewing the WebApp without SMAQ
You can still view the WebApp without building the harware (using fake data), having cloned SMAQ into your local directory, run:
```
cd SMAQ/Software/Website
npm install
node fakeDataGenerator.js &
node app.js &
```
Killing the process follows the same logic as <b>Killing the process</b>
