SMAQ is designed to monitor the air quality in your chosen environment. The sampling rate can be adjusted from 1Hz to 10Hz. The ```./Software/Real-Time``` repo handles all low-level I2C communications and transmits the data via UDP (over port 65000) in real time as the data is sampled - to a JavaScript UDP receiver.
The UDP receiver places the data in a csv file which is then used to populate live DyGraphs and dashboard gauges for each parameter. The data is stored up to a week and follows a ring-buffer logic afterwards (storage time can be modified depending on the available disk space & user preference).
An express WebApp is launched from ```./Software/Website``` repo on port 8000 and can be accessed via url "ipofRaspberryPi:8000" within the same network.

- SMAQ is able to:
    - Sense:
        - Temperature: <b>-45 to 80 Â°C</b>
        - Pressure: <b>300 to 1250 hPa</b>
        - Humidity: <b>0 to 100 %</b>
        - Ambient Light: <b>0.25 to 16K lux</b>
        - Proximity: <b>1 to 200 mm</b>
        - Sound Levels: <b>0 to 100 %</b>
        - Carbon Monoxide: <b>1 to 1000 ppm</b>
        - Nitrogen Dioxide: <b>0.05 to 10 ppm</b>
        - Ammonia: <b>1 to 500 ppm</b>
    - Show the current conditions in your chosen environment with gauges
    - Store data up to a week, autozoom to 1wk | 5d | 3d | 24hr | 12 hr | 6hr | 1hr on WebApp
    - Send you immediate alerts via Email / Mobile Notifications and LEDs
    - Auto-remove your alerts when they are outdated
    - Output API data in JSON format
    - Display current conditions on an OLED display triggered by proximity
    
## PCB Design
The design files are in sub-directory ```./Hardware```

## Pre-requisites
These are the packages required by SMAQ software, you need to have them installed on your raspberry Pi. They can be installed by running ```sudo apt-get install <package_name>```
```
gcc g++
cmake
git
npm
nodejs
```
Additionally, for receiving your alerts via email, you will need a <b>mailtrap</b> account for development and a <b>SendGrid</b> account for production. You will need to create your own ```config.env``` file and provide your keys. See ```./Software/Website/example-config.env.txt``` for a template.

## Building and running a demo
Clone and build the project with CMake
```
git clone https://github.com/MustafaBiyikli/SMAQ.git
cd SMAQ/Software/Real-Time
cmake .
make
```
Cmake will automatically check the I2C communication and run the necesarry tests when building the project. Test your harware by running a test.
```
./demo
```

This will start printing the sensor data onto your terminal. Press ```Enter``` to stop execution.

## Running the full WebApp
Start the cpp udp_transmitter in ```./Software/Real-Time``` as a background process:
```
./udp_transmit &
```

Then cd into ```../Website``` and run:
```
npm install
```

This will install the necessary NodeJS packages for the WebApp. Then, udp_receive.js and app.js needs to run as background processes. To do so, run the app in <b>production mode</b>:
```
npm run start:prod &
```
or:
```
node udp_receive.js &
node app.js &
```
You can now visit your SMAQ WebApp on url: "ipofRaspberryPi:8000"

## Killing the processes
To stop the background process, find their PIDs by:
```
ps ax
```
and kill each process by:

```
kill -HUP <PID>
```

## Viewing the WebApp without SMAQ
You can still view the WebApp without building the harware (using fake data), having cloned SMAQ into your local directory, you will need to start the app in <b>development mode</b>:
```
cd SMAQ/Software/Website
npm install
npm run start:dev &
```
or:
```
cd SMAQ/Software/Website
npm install
node fakeDataGenerator.js &
node app.js &
```
Killing the process follows the same logic as <b>Killing the process</b>

## Hosted Website

Vist SMAQ WebApp on: <b>http://ec2-3-133-80-126.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/</b> or <b>http://3.133.80.126:8000/</b>
Data you see here is randomly generated up to 1 minute as it is in development, however, the working principle is the same. You can have an idea of how SMAQ works without having to clone our repository.
